# 🙋 C and C++

I started learning C and C++ because projects from 42 Seoul required me to learn these languages. C and C++ are powerful programming languages widely used for system software, application development, high-performance computing, and embedded systems. They offer low-level memory manipulation capabilities and are essential for understanding how software interacts with hardware.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Dev Note

The purpose of this Dev Note is to serve as a practical reference guide for myself and others who may need a quick refresher on specific concepts in C and C++. It consolidates essential topics, code snippets, and explanations that can be easily accessed when needed. By organizing the information into structured markdown files, it becomes a handy cheat sheet that aids in efficient learning and development.

## 🌐 Overview of C and C++

C is a procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s. It provides low-level access to memory and offers a minimalistic set of keywords, making it suitable for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

C++, developed as an extension of C, introduces object-oriented programming features, generic programming through templates, and additional standard libraries. It retains compatibility with C while offering higher-level abstractions, making it suitable for complex software development, game development, and applications requiring both performance and abstraction.

## 🔍 Key Differences between C and C++

| Feature              | C                              | C++                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Programming Paradigm | Procedural                     | Procedural & Object-Oriented           |
| Standard Libraries   | Smaller                        | Rich Standard Template Library (STL)   |
| Memory Management    | Manual (`malloc`, `free`)      | `new`, `delete`, Smart Pointers        |
| Features             | Functions, Structures          | Classes, Inheritance, Templates, etc.  |
| Compatibility        | -                              | Backward-compatible with most of C     |
